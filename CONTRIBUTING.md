## 1. About Code Modification Proposals

Pull requests for code modifications are **not accepted**.  

- Because the code is updated in synchronization with the non-public version **Path List Pro**, independent changes to Path List alone would break consistency between the two versions.

## 2. About Translation Contributions

Translation targets are listed in `docs/UI Strings for Localization.xlsx`.

- **Currently supported languages** (Japanese, English, and German):  
  Suggestions and improvements are welcome.

- **Languages not yet developed**:  
  We are **not currently accepting** new translation collaborations.

    Note:  
    - The developer uses AI to create initial drafts in order to avoid placing unnecessary workload on contributors.  
    - After the draft is created, proofreading and improvement suggestions are warmly welcomed.  
    - Please note that even for the same language, separate submissions to the Microsoft Store may be required for each region, which can delay release.
