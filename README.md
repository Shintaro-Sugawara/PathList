# Path List / Path List Pro

This tool generates a list of full file paths (absolute paths).  
Simply drag and drop a folder onto the application icon to start.

It fully supports Unicode, ensuring correct handling of characters from any language.  
The application interface is available in Japanese, English, and German, with more languages planned.

This app does not access the web, display ads, or modify the registry.  
It does not communicate with external servers or collect any personal data, ensuring complete safety and privacy.

## How to Use (Free and Pro versions)

(For first-time use only) Create a shortcut to `PathList.exe` or `PathListPro.exe` on your desktop.  
Drag and drop a folder (or its shortcut) onto the application icon.  
- You can drag and drop multiple folders at once. (Tree mode is not supported.)  
In the dialog that appears, select the output settings and click **[OK]**.  
- If you want to use the default settings, just press **[Enter]**.  
After the output is complete, a list file will be created on your desktop.

## About Free and Pro Versions

The free version is a fully functional app packed with features the developer personally uses every day.  
To ensure a smooth experience, it does not display ads, impose usage limits, or prompt you to upgrade to the Pro version.

The Pro version adds the following features:  
The tree-structured view and Excel output features are especially useful.

1. In addition to path listing (List mode), you can generate output in a tree structure (Tree mode).  
2. You can filter file and folder names (excluding paths) by search keyword.  
   - Example: Searching for ".xlsx" (suffix match) extracts Excel files.  
3. You can extract the following information:  
   - File/folder name (excluding path)  
   - Size  
   - Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)  
4. Output format options:  
   - `.txt`  
   - `.csv`  
   - `.csv` (fields enclosed in double quotes)  
   - `.xlsx`

## Feature List (List Mode)

- Target: Files / Folders  
- Include subfolders: Yes / No  
- Search keyword (Pro version only)  
- Size (Pro version only)  
- File/folder name (excluding path) (Pro version only): with/without extension  
- Timestamps (Pro version only): created / modified / accessed  
- Output formats (Pro version only): Text / CSV / Quoted CSV / Excel  
  Note: Excel files can be generated even if Microsoft Excel is not installed.

Note: In Command Prompt, Unicode characters (e.g., "Résumé") may display correctly on screen but become garbled in output files.  
Path List and Path List Pro support Unicode and correctly output characters from any language.

Equivalent Command Prompt examples:  
```
dir /b /s /a-d > %USERPROFILE%\desktop\FileList.txt
```
```
dir /b /s /ad > %USERPROFILE%\desktop\FolderList.txt
```

---

## Feature List (Tree Mode) [Pro version only]

- Retrieve file info: Yes / No (equivalent to `tree /f` option)  
- Output style: Normal / ASCII characters (equivalent to `tree /a` option)

Note: In English/German environments, the `/a` option affects screen output in Command Prompt,  
but file output is always in `/a` format. Path List Pro allows output without `/a`, matching the on-screen display.

Reference command:  
```
tree /f > %USERPROFILE%\desktop\FileTree.txt
```
